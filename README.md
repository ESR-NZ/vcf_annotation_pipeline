# vcf_annotation_pipeline

A Snakemake workflow to filter raw variants (snp and indels) and annotate vcf (variant call format) files of single samples (unrelated individuals) or cohort samples (related individuals) of paired-end sequencing data (WGS or WES) using [GATK4](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us), [SnpSift](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpSift.html), [VEP](https://asia.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html), [genmod](https://github.com/moonso/genmod) and [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/). The vcf file can be optionally be prepared for ingestion into [scout](http://www.clinicalgenomics.se/scout/) which involves the removal of multiallelic sites and scoring/ranking of variants. The pipeline can run on [NVIDIA GPU's](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/graphics-cards/) where [nvidia clara parabricks software is available](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/docs/parabricks/quickstart-guide/software-overview/) for *significant* speedups in analysis times. This pipeline is designed be used after [human_genomics_pipeline](https://github.com/ESR-NZ/human_genomics_pipeline) and before the data is ingested into [scout](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout) for clinical interpretation. However, this pipeline also stands on it's own, as a vcf annotation pipeline. This pipeline has been developed with human genetic data in mind, however we designed it to be species agnostic. Genetic data from other species can be analysed by setting a species-specific reference genome and variant databases in the configuration file (but not all situations have been tested).
